-- | Provides a safe idiom to acquire and release resources safely.
--
-- When acquiring and operating on a resource (such as opening and
-- reading file handle with 'openFile' or writing to a blob of memory
-- with 'malloc'), any exception thrown during the operation may mean
-- that the resource is not properly released. @bracket acquire release op@
-- ensures that @release@ is run on the value returned from @acquire@ even
-- if @op@ throws an exception.
--
-- 'bracket' is safe in the presence of asynchronous exceptions.
